This is probably all, that can be retrieved out of the books that are here.
Thereby have I, as it seems, originated from latest data (Johanna Kristina Blomqvist´s death day).

When Parish Book A 11:1 established (1899) was the spouses Anders August & Johanna Kristina Blomqvist already earlier at Bengtstorp under Svinorp,
and they are found argain at the same place in the last Catechetical Length.
However, all catechetical lengths is already delivered to Landsarkivet (the regional archives) in Vadstena.
Here are whatsoever no older books than PB A 11:1 and DBB C:3.

I can not find anything about Johannes Pettersson here. Then you have to go to the regional archives, and go into either 
Hvarf´s last catechetical length (Bengtstorp) or in the catechetical length for Ask 1849, when Johanna Kristina was born.

Yours sincerely
